Description: Export MySQL metrics
 The Prometheus MySQLd Exporter exports MySQL server metrics.
 .
 Supported MySQL versions: 5.1 and up.
 .
 NOTE: Not all collection methods are supported on MySQL < 5.6
 .
 NOTE: It is recommended to set a max connection limit for the user to
 avoid overloading the server with monitoring scrapes under heavy load.
 You can do so by shadowing the systemd service file and setting a
 different file. User requirements:
 .
 CREATE USER 'exporter'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'XXXXXXXX' WITH
 MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 3; GRANT PROCESS, REPLICATION CLIENT, SELECT
 ON *.* TO 'exporter'@'localhost';
